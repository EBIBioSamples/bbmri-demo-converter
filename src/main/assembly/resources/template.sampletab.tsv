# Notes			
# This is a mock-up encoding of http://goo.gl/dvEPGB			
# We'd like to read diseases and materials in the BBMRI instance, and report corresponding columns on SampleTab 			
# Disease codes are always based on ICD and can be solved via Bioportal (https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/bioportal-client)			
# Material labels can be solved by means of ZOOMA (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/fgpt/zooma/, https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/zooma)			
# Columns are headed either as Characteristic[] or specific headers, according to SampleTab documentation: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/help/st_scd.html
